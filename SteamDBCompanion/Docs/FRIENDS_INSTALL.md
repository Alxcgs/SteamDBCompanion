# Friends Install Guide (Free)

This guide explains how your friends can install `SteamDB Companion` for free.

## Important limits (free Apple ID)

- Each person must sign the app with their own Apple ID.
- The app certificate usually expires in about 7 days.
- The app must be refreshed/reinstalled after expiration.
- This is normal for free sideloading.

## Option A: AltStore (recommended for friends)

### What your friend needs

- iPhone (Developer Mode enabled)
- Windows or macOS computer
- Apple ID (free is fine)
- AltServer + AltStore
- `SteamDBCompanion.ipa` file from you

### Install steps

1. Install AltServer on computer.
2. Install AltStore on iPhone using AltServer.
3. Open AltStore on iPhone.
4. Tap `My Apps` -> `+` and select `SteamDBCompanion.ipa`.
5. Enter Apple ID credentials when asked.
6. After install: trust developer profile on iPhone.

### Trust profile (if app does not open)

1. `Settings` -> `General` -> `VPN & Device Management`
2. Select the Apple ID profile.
3. Tap `Trust`.

## Option B: Sideloadly

### What your friend needs

- iPhone
- Windows or macOS computer
- Apple ID (free is fine)
- Sideloadly app
- `SteamDBCompanion.ipa` file from you

### Install steps

1. Open Sideloadly on computer.
2. Connect iPhone by cable (or Wi-Fi pairing if configured).
3. Drag `SteamDBCompanion.ipa` into Sideloadly.
4. Enter Apple ID and press `Start`.
5. After install: trust developer profile on iPhone.

## Developer Mode (iOS 16+)

If iOS blocks launch, enable Developer Mode:

1. `Settings` -> `Privacy & Security` -> `Developer Mode`
2. Turn it on and restart iPhone.
3. Confirm after reboot.

## Refresh every ~7 days

- AltStore: open AltStore and press `Refresh` before expiration.
- Sideloadly: run install again.
- If app expires, just reinstall and trust profile again.

## What you should share with friends

- `SteamDBCompanion.ipa`
- This file (`FRIENDS_INSTALL.md`)
- Short note: "Use your own Apple ID for signing."

## Quick troubleshooting

- `App crashes at launch`: re-sign and reinstall.
- `Untrusted developer`: trust profile in `VPN & Device Management`.
- `Install failed`: reconnect cable, unlock iPhone, retry.
- `Certificate expired`: refresh/reinstall.
